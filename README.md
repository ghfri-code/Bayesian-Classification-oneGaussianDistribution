Dataset : BC-Train1, BC-Test1, BC-Train2, BC-Test2
In this part you have two datasets (Dataset1= BC-Train1, BC-Test1, Dataset2 = BC-Train2, BC-
Test2 ). Each dataset contains two classes and each class generated from one Gaussian distribution.
In this part you have to construct two Bayesian classifiers so as to classify both train and test data.
• Use a Bayesian classifier to classify both the train and test datasets and calculate both
accuracies (for each dataset separately).
• Plot the decision boundary and classification results while representing the misclassi-
fied samples with a different color or shape (for each dataset separately).
• Plot estimated PDFs. (3D for each dataset separately)
• Contour estimated PDFs along with the decision boundary. (2D for each dataset
separately)
• What is the main difference between two datasets? Explain your answer using your
results and plots.
