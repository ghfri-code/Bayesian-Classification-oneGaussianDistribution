# Bayesian Classification
In this part you have two datasets. Each dataset contains two classes and each class generated from one Gaussian distribution.
In this part you have to construct two Bayesian classifiers so as to classify both train and test data.

### Plot the decision boundary and classification results:

### Plot estimated PDFs. (3D for each dataset separately):

### Contour estimated PDFs along with the decision boundary. (2D for each dataset separately):
